# Spam Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on detecting spam messages using various classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

The spam detection model is trained to distinguish between 'spam' (unwanted and unsolicited messages) and 'ham' (non-spam messages). The project includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing of text data, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the spam detection model consists of labeled text messages. Each message is classified as either 'ham' or 'spam'.

## Files in the Repository

- `Spam_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `spam.csv`: The dataset file containing the spam and ham messages.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python libraries required to run the notebook.
