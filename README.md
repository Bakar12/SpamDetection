# Spam Detection Model

This repository contains a machine-learning project that detects spam messages using various classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

The spam detection model is trained to distinguish between 'spam' (unwanted and unsolicited messages) and 'ham' (non-spam messages). The project includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing of text data, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset for training the spam detection model consists of labelled text messages. Each message is classified as either 'ham' or 'spam'.
